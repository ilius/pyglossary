An Analysis of MDX/MDD File Format
==================================

> MDict is a multi-platform open dictionary

which are both questionable. It is not available for every platform, e.g. OS X, Linux. Its dictionary file format is not open. But this has not hindered its popularity, and many dictionaries have been created for it.

This is an attempt to reveal MDX/MDD file format, so that my favarite dictionaries, created by MDict users, could be used elsewhere.

MDict Files
===========

MDict stores the dictionary definitions, i.e. (key word, explanation) in MDX file and the dictionary reference data, e.g. images, pronunciations, stylesheets in MDD file. Although holding different contents, these two file formats share the same structure.

MDX and MDD File Formats
========================

See [MDX.svgz](./MDX.svgz) and [MDD.svgz](./MDD.svgz)

Example Programs
================

readmdict.py
------------

readmdict.py is an example implementation in Python. This program can read/extract mdx/mdd files.

**NOTE:** python-lzo is required to read mdx files created with enegine 1.2. Get Windows version from http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#python-lzo

It can be used as a command line tool. Suppose one has oald8.mdx and oald8.mdd::

```
$ python readmdict.py -x oald8.mdx
```

This will creates *oald8.txt* dictionary file and creates a folder *data* for images, pronunciation audio files.

On Windows, one can also double click it and select the file in the popup dialog.

Or as a module::

```
In [1]: from readmdict import MDX, MDD
```

Read MDX file and print the first entry::

```
In [2]: mdx = MDX('oald8.mdx')

In [3]: items = mdx.items()

In [4]: items.next()
Out[4]:
('A',
 '<span style=\'display:block;color:black;\'>.........')
```

`mdx` is an object having all info from a MDX file. `items` is an iterator producing 2-item tuples. Of each tuple, the first element is the entry text and the second is the explanation. Both are UTF-8 encoded strings.

Read MDD file and print the first entry::

```
In [5]: mdd = MDD('oald8.mdd')

In [6]: items = mdd.items()

In [7]: items = mdd.next()
Out[7]: 
('\\pic\\accordion_concertina.jpg',
'\xff\xd8\xff\xe0\x00\x10JFIF...........')
```

`mdd` is an object having all info from a MDD file. `items` is an iterator producing 2-item tuples. Of each tuple, the first element is the file name and the second element is the corresponding file content. The file name is encoded in UTF-8. The file content is a plain bytes array.
