- Break compatibility of plugins

  - Drop support for read and write functions (outside a class)
  - Now we only support Reader class and Writer class
  - Reader class must have these methods
    - `__init__(self, glos)`
    - `open(self, filename)`
      - Here glossary info must be read from file and set with `glos.setInfo`
    - `__len__(self) -> int`
      - Should return the number or entries, or zero if it's too costly
    - `__iter__(self) -> "Iterator[BaseEntry]"`
      - Can be a generator
    - `close(self)`
  - Writer class must have these methods
    - `__init__(self, glos)`

    - `open(self, filename)`

      - Here glossary info must be read from `glos.getInfo` or `glos.iterInfo` and written to file

    - `write(self) -> "Generator[None, BaseEntry, None]"`

      - Entries must be fetched with `entry = yield` in a `while True` loop:

        ```python
        while True:
        	entry = yield
        	if entry is None:
        		break
        	# process and write entry into file(s)
        ```

    - `finish(self)`
  - Read options and write options must be set to their default values as class attributes
    - See `pyglossary/plugins/csv_pyg.py` plugin for example
  - `sortKey` must be an instance method of Writer, instead of a function outside any class
    - Only for plugins that need sorting before write

      - `pyglossary/plugins/dict_org_source.py`
      - `pyglossary/plugins/json_plugin.py`
