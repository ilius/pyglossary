Changes since version 2016.03.18
================================

New versioning
--------------

-	Using *date* as the version was a mistake I made 7 years ago
-	From now on, versions are in **X.Y.Z** format (*major.minor.patch*\)
-	While X, Y and Z are digits(0-9) for simplicity (version strings can be compared alphabetically)
-	Starting from 3.0.0
	-	Take it for migrating to Python 3.x, or Gtk 3.x, or being alphabetically larger than previous versions (date string)

Since I believe this is the first *standard version*, I'm not sure which code revision should I compare it with. So I just write the most important recent changes, in both application-view and library-view.

Breaking Compatibility
----------------------

-	**Config migration**
	-	Config file becomes a **config directory** containing config file
	-	Config file format changes from Python (loaded by `exec`) to **JSON**
	-	Remove some obsolete / unused config parameters, and rename some
	-	Remove permanent `sort` boolean flag
	-	Must give `--sort` in command line to enable sorting for most of output formats
	-	Load user-defined plugins from a directory named `plugins` inside config directory
-	**Glossary class**
	-	Remove some obsolete / unused method
	-	`copy`, `attach`, `merge`, `deepMerge`, `takeWords`, `getInputList`, `getOutputList`
	-	Rename some methods:
	-	`reverseDic` -> `reverse`
	-	Make some public attributes private:
	-	`data` -> `_data`
	-	`info` -> `_info`
	-	`filename` -> `_filename`
	-	Clear (reset) the Glossary instance (data, info, etc) after `write` operation
	-	Glossary class is for converting from file(s) to file, not keeping data in memory
	-	New methods:
	-	`convert`:
		-	`convert` method is added to be used instead of `read` and then `write`
		-	Not just for convenience, but it's also recommended,
		-	and let's Glossary class to have a better default behavior
		-	for example it enables *direct* mode by default (stay tuned) if sorting is not enabled (by user or plugin)
		-	all UI modules (Command line, Gtk3, Tkinter) use Glossary.convert method now
	-	Sorting policy
	-	`sort` boolean flag is now an argument to `write` method
		-	sort=True if user gives `--sort` in command line
		-	sort=False if user gives `--no-sort` in command line
		-	sort=None if user does not give either, so `write` method itself decides what to do
	-	Now we allow plugins to specify sorting policy based on output format
		-	By `sortOnWrite` variable in plugin, with allowed values:
		-	`ALWAYS`: force sorting even if sort=False (user gives `--no-sort`), used only for writing StarDict
		-	`DEFAULT_YES`: enable sorting unless sort=False (user gives `--no-sort`\)
		-	`DEFAULT_NO`: disable sorting unless sort=True (user gives `--sort`\)
		-	`NEVER`: disable sorting even if sort=True (user gives `--sort`\)
		-	The default and common value is: `sortOnWrite = DEFAULT_NO`
		-	Plugin can also have a global `sortKey` function to be used for sorting
		-	(like the `key` argument to `list.sort` method, See `pydoc list.sort`\)
	-	New way of interacting with Glossary instance in plugins:
	-	`glos.data.append((word, defi))` -> `glos.addEntry(word, defi)`
	-	`for item in glos.data:` -> `for entry in glos:`
	-	`for key, value in glos.info.items():` -> `for key, value in glos.iterInfo():`

Gtk2 to Gtk3
------------

-	Replace obsolete PyGTK-based interface with a simpler PyGI-based (Gtk3) interface

Migrating to Python 3
---------------------

-	Even though `master` branch was based on Python 3 since 2016 Apr 29, there was some problem that are fixed in this release
-	If you are still forced need to use Python 2.7, you can use branch `python2.7`

Introducing Direct mode
-----------------------

-	`--direct` command line option
-	reads and writes at the same time, without loading the whole data into memory
-	Partial sorting is supported
	-	`--sort` in command line
	-	`--sort-cache-size=1000` is optional
-	If plugin defines sortOnWrite=ALWAYS, it means output format requires full sorting, so direct mode will be disabled
-	As mentioned above (using `Glossary.convert` method), direct mode is enabled by default if sorting is not enabled (by user or plugin)
-	Of course user can manually disable direct mode by giving `--indirect` option in command line

Progress Bar
------------

Automatic command line Progress Bar for all input / output formats is now supported

-	Implemented based on plugins Reader classes
-	Works both for direct mode and indirect mode
	-	Only one progress bar for direct mode
	-	Two progress bars for indirect mode (one while reading, one while writing)
-	Plugins must not update the progress bar anymore
-	Still no progress bar when both `--direct` and `--sort` flags are given, will be fixed later
-	User can disable progress bar by giving `--no-progress-bar` option (recommended for Windows users)

BGL Plugin
----------

-	BGL plugin works better now (comparing to latest Python 2.7 code), and it's much cleaner too
-	I totally refactored the code, made it fully Python3-compatible, and much more easier to understand
-	This fixes bytes/str bugs (like Bug [#54](https://github.com/ilius/pyglossary/issues/54)), and CRC check problem for some glossaries (Bug [#55](https://github.com/ilius/pyglossary/issues/55)\)
-	I'm a fan of micro-commits and I usually hate single-commit refactoring, but this time I had no choice!

Other Changes
-------------

**Feature**: Add `encoding` option to read and write drivers of some plain-text formats

**Feature**: SQL and SQLite: read/write extra information from/to a new table dbinfo_extra, backward compatible

**New format** invented and implemented for *later implementation of a Glossary Editor*

-	`edlin.py` (*Editable Linked List of Entries*) is optimized for adding/modifying/removing one entry at a time
-	while we can save the changes instantly after each modification
-	Using the ideas of Doubly Linked List, and Git's hash-based object database

Rewrite non-working **Reverse** functionality

-	The old code was messy, not working by default, slow, and language-dependent
-	It's much faster and cleaner now

Improve and complete command line help (`-h` or `--help`\)
