| term_bank_size               | `10000` | int  | The number of terms in each term bank json file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| term_from_headword_only      | `True`  | bool | If set to true, only create a term for the headword for each entry, as opposed to create one term for each alternate word. If the headword is ignored by the `ignore_word_with_pattern` option, the next word in the alternate list that is not ignored is used as headword.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| no_term_from_reading         | `True`  | bool | When there are multiple alternate words, don't create term for the one that is the same as the the reading form, which is chosen to be the first alternate forms that consists solely of Hiragana and Katakana. For example, an entry could contain both '„Å†„ÅÑ„Åå„Åè' and 'Â§ßÂ≠¶' as alternate words. Setting this option to true would prevent a term to be created for the former.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| delete_word_pattern          |         | str  | When given, all non-overlapping matches of this regular expression are removed from word strings. For example, if an entry has word '„ÅÇ„Åæ¬∑„ÅÑ', setting the pattern to `¬∑` removes all center dots, or more precisely use `¬∑(?=[\u3040-\u309F])` to only remove center dots that precede Hiragana characters. Either way, the original word is replaced with '„ÅÇ„Åæ„ÅÑ'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ignore_word_with_pattern     |         | str  | When given, don't create terms for a word if any of its substrings matches this regular expression. For example, an entry could contain both '„Å†„ÅÑ„Åå„Åè„ÄêÂ§ßÂ≠¶„Äë' and 'Â§ßÂ≠¶' as alternate words. Setting this option with value `r'„Äê.+„Äë'` would prevent a term to be created for the former.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| alternates_from_word_pattern |         | str  | When given, the regular expression is used to find additional alternate words for the same entry from matching substrings in the original words. If there are no capturing groups in the regular expression, then all matched substrings are added to the list of alternate words. If there are capturing groups, then substrings matching the groups are added to the alternate words list instead. For example, if an entry has '„Å†„ÅÑ„Åå„Åè„ÄêÂ§ßÂ≠¶„Äë' as a word, then `\w+(?=„Äê)` adds '„Å†„ÅÑ„Åå„Åè' as an additional word, while `(\w+)„Äê(\w+)„Äë` adds both '„Å†„ÅÑ„Åå„Åè' and 'Â§ßÂ≠¶'.                            |
| alternates_from_defi_pattern |         | str  | When given, the regular expression is used to find additional alternate words for the same entry from matching substrings in the definition. `^` and `$` can be used to match start and end of lines, respectively. If there are no capturing groups in the regular expression, then all matched substrings are added to the list of alternate words. If there are capturing groups, then substrings matching the groups are added to the alternate words list instead. For example, if an entry has '„Å†„ÅÑ„Åå„Åè„ÄêÂ§ßÂ≠¶„Äë' in its definition, then `\w+„Äê(\w+)„Äë` adds 'Â§ßÂ≠¶' as an additional word. |
| rule_v1_defi_pattern         |         | str  | When given, if any substring of an entry's definition matches this regular expression, then the term(s) created from entry are labeled as ichidan verb. Yomichan uses this information to match conjugated forms of words. `^` and `$` can be used to match start and end of lines, respectively. For example, setting this option to `^\(Âãï[‰∏ä‰∏ã]‰∏Ä\)$` identifies entries where there's a line of '(Âãï‰∏ä‰∏Ä)' or '(Âãï‰∏ã‰∏Ä)'.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| rule_v5_defi_pattern         |         | str  | When given, if any substring of an entry's definition matches this regular expression, then the term(s) created from entry are labeled as godan verb. Yomichan uses this information to match conjugated forms of words. `^` and `$` can be used to match start and end of lines, respectively. For example, setting this option to `^\(Âãï‰∫î\)$` identifies entries where there's a line of '(Âãï‰∫î)'.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| rule_vs_defi_pattern         |         | str  | When given, if any substring of an entry's definition matches this regular expression, then the term(s) created from entry are labeled as suru verb. Yomichan uses this information to match conjugated forms of words. `^` and `$` can be used to match start and end of lines, respectively. For example, setting this option to `^„Çπ„É´$` identifies entries where there's a line of '„Çπ„É´'.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| rule_vk_defi_pattern         |         | str  | When given, if any substring of an entry's definition matches this regular expression, then the term(s) created from entry are labeled as kuru verb. Yomichan uses this information to match conjugated forms of words. `^` and `$` can be used to match start and end of lines, respectively. For example, setting this option to `^\(Âãï„Ç´Â§â\)$` identifies entries where there's a line of '(Âãï„Ç´Â§â)'.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| rule_adji_defi_pattern       |         | str  | When given, if any substring of an entry's definition matches this regular expression, then the term(s) created from entry are labeled as i-adjective. Yomichan uses this information to match conjugated forms of words. `^` and `$` can be used to match start and end of lines, respectively. For example, setting this option to `r'^\(ÂΩ¢\)$'` identify entries where there's a line of '(ÂΩ¢)'.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
